## Kim's Reads - organize your library!

This project was my first time building a complete program with React.js!  I really enjoyed it and I hope you do as well.  You may move books from one shelf to another, as well as add and delete books from your library.



## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
